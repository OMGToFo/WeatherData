# WeatherData
A simple app that shows current weather data from Open-Meteo.com and historical weather data from https://meteostat.net of a selected location over the years.
I also integrated a prediction functionality with Prophet which also shows trends which i find interesting, and been playing around with some features in streamlit and python. Amazing what's available open source.
